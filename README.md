# Live Weather App 🌦️

I created this Live Weather App using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project fetches real-time weather data from the **OpenWeatherMap API** and displays current weather and forecast details in a clean and responsive UI.

## About the Project
This project allows users to search for any city and view its current weather conditions along with hourly and weekly forecasts.  
I also implemented proper error handling so that if a city is not found or data fails to load, the user gets a clear message instead of a blank screen.
